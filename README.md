# ts clients generator CLI

This is a command line application that facilitates creating clients using apis that follow the openapi spec, to see all options use `--help`

- OpenApiTools (which generates the clients) requires [java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) to be installed on your machine.

# Example usage

```bash
pnpm i @fohoov/ts-client-generator
pnpm exec client-generator --help
```

or

```bash
pnpm dlx @fohoov/ts-client-generator --help
```
